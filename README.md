Symbiotic
=========
Symbiotic is a set of protocols and binaries to share various devices with
other computers.

The plan include clipboard, keyboard and mouse sharing.

Why
---
I'm well aware there's already [Synergy](http://synergy-project.org/), but I
found it buggy and not enough UNIXy in its ways.

If I want to share a mouse from one machine and the keyboard from another, I'm
out of luck.

Symbiotic will be separated in well-concerned binaries, so you'll be able to
achieve that.
